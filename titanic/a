My first insight about text analysis is about how different it is from other ways of reading a text.

Like, instead of reading it passively or simply reading the contents to cite it for something else,
you write about the text itself which is very meta. 

It really forces you to think about a piece of literature like an essay in a completely different way.

Reading analytically to reading passively is what linguistics is to learning a language!

You're studying the argument itself, you're studying HOW the author uses techniques to persuade the audience, and you're studying the structure of the text.

I thought that that was a very nice way to look at things.

My second reading insight is how complicated it can be to analyze a single piece of text.

And I learned a lot about this in Chapter 6 around pages 172

It's more than just seeing the argument. There's always something that can be expanded on.

For example, it can be difficult to discuss the purpose of a text.

Sometimes it may not be very clear what the author is trying to convey. Sometimes its subjective.

Other times, when it IS clear what the author's intent is, it's important to categorize all of the

ways that an author makes their argument.

They could be using statistics, narration, or figurative language to make their points.


This is important to analyzing a text because they are the building blocks of an argument. 

If we don't identify what the building blocks are then there is no analysis.

====

The third insight is how important the choice of words can be in a text.

It can reveal a lot about an author's intent and how the argument is being made.

Like, choosing a negative word over a neutral word can tell us a lot about an author's position
in an argument and what they think of the other side.

Every single word in the text is a decision that the author has made - and that's super interesting

because it makes analysis a lot easier.
